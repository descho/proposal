      <p>Dear Carrie & Dom,</p>
      <h1 class="project-name">Let’s work together!</h1>
      <p>
      My name is <a href="http://chongarova.com/about/" target="_blank">Dessy</a> and I am about to graduate from Hyper Island’s <a href="https://www.hyperisland.com/programs-and-courses/ma-digital-experience-design" target="_blank">MA in Digital Experience Design</a>. From October to February I will be working on my Industry Research Project, which is like a work-based thesis. I would love to spend some of that time with FutureGov, because I admire your work and your team’s dance moves! Please continue reading to find out how I think we can collaborate.

      <h3>A Good Fit</h3>
      <p>
After <a href="https://medium.com/@des_cho/design-that-matters-ac0fdf9490aa" target="_blank">meeting Dom</a> at Hyper Island and chatting with Roxana at your summer party, I feel I know what FutureGov stands for. I appreciate that you take your projects from design, through implementation, to the organisational changes needed for them to be successful. I am even more interested in your ventures, as I believe that learning and design iterations should continue after a product has been launched.
      </p>
      <p>
I am passionate about bringing the high quality experiences of consumer market apps to areas that are underserved by design, like public services and enterprise technology. In the long term I hope to pioneer a user-centred approach to public services in my home country, Bulgaria, where design is not yet part of the conversation when it comes to government.
      </p>
      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p>
I have worked as a UX designer within multidisciplinary agile teams in both startup and agency environments. In startup land I learned how a good process could help a team see purpose in their work. At the agency I worked in, I learned how to help clients discover what they and their users need.
      </p>
      <p> 
At Hyper Island, through working with clients like the BBC and Future Cities Catapult, I learned about co-design and prototyping with communities. I participated in and facilitated team development using techniques like feedback and reflection. You can find out more about my professional experience and skills on <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/descho" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>What is an Industry Research Project</h3>
      <p>
The Industry Research Project (IRP) is the culmination of a Hyper Island Masters programme. We are expected to do research, come up with hypotheses, test them, and present a work-based thesis that adds value and challenges the industry. The output of the project could be a final report or a creative portfolio.
      </p>
      <p> 
As part of their IRPs previous students have worked with large design firms like <a href="http://www.ideo.com/uk/" target="_blank">IDEO</a> and <a href="http://www.akqa.com/" target="_blank">AKQA</a>, and social-good focused organisations like <a href="http://www.impacthub.net/" target="_blank">Impact Hub</a>. I want to work on my IRP with you.  
      </p>  
      <h3>In Practice</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main research areas that I am interested in:
        <ol>
          <li>Applying human-centred design and agile methodologies in the domain of public services and social innovation. This area is more process-focused.</li>
          <li>Inclusive design and accessibility. This has more to do with cognitive psychology. It includes questions like: How to design for everybody? How do skills, age and culture influence a person’s experience with a product or service?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
These areas are broad on purpose for now. I plan to narrow my research question down based on the projects I will be working on and the needs of the organisation I partner with. If I work with FutureGov, I imagine spending 2/3 of the time doing UX/service design work on client and/or internal projects. And working on my research project the rest of the time. The output of my research may include blog posts, tool kits, or prototypes that I believe will be of value for FutureGov.
      </p>
      <p>
What I’ll need from you is regular feedback and a modest intern salary. I am open to discussing all details.
