      <p>Dear Carrie & Dom,</p>
      <h1 class="project-name">Let’s work together!</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Dessy and I’m about to graduate from Hyper Island’s MA in Digital Experience Design. From October to February I will be working on my Industry Research Project which is like a work based thesis. I’d love to spend some of that time with FutureGov, because I love your work and your team’s dance moves! Please continue reading to find out how we can help each other.

<h3>
My Superpower</h3>
<p>
People that I’ve worked with describe me as enthusiastic and proactive. But the truth is that I’m <strong>naturally curios</strong>. This helps me dig into a topic until I find an insight I can empathise with. Working with clients and users, all I need is a real life problem to get me started. When I’m collaborating with designers, developers or business people, I’m interested in what gets them going and what I can learn about their work. Since every project is different and our industry is constantly evolving, my curiosity helps me fill gaps that I can identify.

<h3>
What Makes me Angry</h3>

<p>
  One thing that makes me angry, are forms. https://twitter.com/allafarce/status/626960212210008064 Bad forms, both offline and online are representative of evil or negligent organisations that don’t care about people. They ask them to fill in things they already know, or can find out from context. They are difficult to understand, make people feel stupid and prevent them from getting their job done. They violate privacy for the sake of marketing.
