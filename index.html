      <p>Dear Carrie & Dom,</p>
      <h1 class="project-name">Let’s work together!</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Dessy and I’m about to graduate from Hyper Island’s MA in Digital Experience Design. From October to February I will be working on my Industry Research Project which is like a work based thesis. I’d love to spend some of that time with FutureGov, because I love your work and your team’s dance moves! Please continue reading to find out how we can help each other.

<h3>
My Superpower</h3>
<p>
People that I’ve worked with describe me as enthusiastic and proactive. But the truth is that I’m <strong>naturally curios</strong>. This helps me dig into a topic until I find an insight I can empathise with. Working with clients and users, all I need is a real life problem to get me started. When I’m collaborating with designers, developers or business people, I’m interested in what gets them going and what I can learn about their work. Since every project is different and our industry is constantly evolving, my curiosity helps me fill gaps that I can identify.

<h3>
What experience I have</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
What I expect from you</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
